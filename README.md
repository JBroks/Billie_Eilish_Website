# Billie Eilish Website

Stream One Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Milestone Project

This is a website about music artist known as Billie Eilish. This website promotes artist's new album, presents her pictures, audio and video clips, tour events, 
as well as allows it's user to subscribe to email list and contact the artist.


## Demo

Website demo is available [here](https://jbroks.github.io/Billie_Eilish_Website/ "Billie_Eilish_Website").

## UX

In my project I was aiming to achieve tidy and well structured design, while providing all essential information. 
I used white-silver-black color scheme to create stylish look and to harmonise with artist's cover artwork and photos.

## Features

### Existing Features

The navabar stays collapsed on mobile devices.
Websites uses the buttons feature in Bootstrap.
Bootstrap forms were used to design contact us form and subscribe.
Arrow on title pages scrolls down to the next section.

### Features left to implement

In the future video carousel could be implemented in the media section.

Also modals for Subscribe and Contact Us form could be implemented to inform the user that their form was submitted.

Validation on forms could be enhanced to check e.g. for valid email domain etc.

## Technologies used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)
4. Font Awesome (4.7.0)


## Testing

Website was tested across different browsers, display sizes and devices to check its responsivness. 

Buttons and links were tested to ensure that they work correctly and are opened in a new page.

Forms were tested to ensure that validation checks work and to make sure that all fields are filled before clicking 'send' button. 
For the email field it was tested if it is possible to send the form without @ symbol. 
All required fields were tested to ensure that form cannot be send without all required information.

Scroll-down arrow was tested to ensure that it works properly on every title page. For most of the section padding was addjusted to make the navbar look good after scroll-down.

Video clips and embeded audio were tested to ensure that they play and full screen works correctly.

## Deployment

This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The live site updates automatically each time there is a new push to the repository.
You can 'git clone' the code to run it locally on your machine.
